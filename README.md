# This is a node.js/mongo server just to service the calls from a React frontend. To deploy:

> npm install
> npm run server
> Open up localhost:8080

A page documenting and demoing the api calls that can be made to the server should render
including the following:

API Calls
api/projects GET
api/projects POST
api/projects PUT
api/projects/:id DELETE

Much of the code in this repo is obfuscated. It's not impossible to reverse engineer but it's not
worth your while.
